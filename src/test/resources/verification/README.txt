This folder contains resources for interoperability tests on signature verification, i.e. verification of
signature generated by third parties. Each subfolder is a test suite containing a set of signatures and the
corresponding validation data. The test suites are discovered automatically as long as they stick to the
following convention:

<folder_name> -> The suite name
|
|
\_ *.cer and *.crt -> Certificates to be used on verification
|    
|    - If a certificate's file name starts with "root", it is considered a trust anchor
|    - Otherwise, it is considered an intermediate certificate
|
\_ *.crl -> CRLs to be used on verification
|
|
\- *.xml and *.xades -> XML files containing the signatures to be verified

     - Each file results in a test case
     - It is assumed that each file contains a single signature (only the first in document order is considered)
     - If the file name has more that 2 parts separed by ".", the segment before the last is the expected XAdES form

		e.g. sig1.BES.xml -> The signature should be verified as a XAdES-BES

     - The first part of the file name is combined with the test suite name to identify the test case

		e.g. "folder_name - sig1.BES.xml"
